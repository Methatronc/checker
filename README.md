"Copy Webhook URL" will get you the url that needs to be put at the 3rd line of checker_discord.sh.

For gotify, see [here](https://gotify.net/docs/pushmsg), it also needs to be put at the 3rd line in checker_gotify.sh.

* **Installation**

   ``` bash
   sudo apt install jq curl wget
   cd && mkdir image_checker && cd image_checker
   # For discord :
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/methatronc/checker/main/checker_discord.sh
   # For gotify :
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/methatronc/checker/main/checker_gotify.sh
   chmod +x checker_[discord/gotify].sh
   su
   crontab -e
   ```
And add the following line for instance :
   ``` bash
   0 5 * * * /home/[your_username]/image_checker/checker_[discord/gotify].sh > /home/[your_username]/image_checker/cron.log 2>&1
   ```
Now you will have your daily report at 5am on your discord server if any image currently used on the host executing the cron gets updated.


* **If you have anything to add please do, some images might need other particular treatment.**
